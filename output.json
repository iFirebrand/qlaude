    "reasoning": "The solution meets all mandatory requirements: it includes daily caloric total (2,800), complete macronutrient breakdown, and all meals with exact foods, portions, and timing. It successfully avoids seafood, uses budget-friendly protein sources, and provides realistic, practical meals. However, there are minor issues with caloric adequacy for the athlete's profile and some calculation inconsistencies between stated and actual macronutrient totals. The pre-workout snack composition could be optimized. These are secondary criterion deficiencies rather than mandatory requirement violations."

    "reasoning": "The solution successfully meets all three mandatory requirements with a clearly stated daily caloric total, complete macronutrient breakdown, and six meals/snacks with exact foods, portions, and specific timing. The lactose-free restriction is perfectly maintained throughout. The carbohydrate-loading approach is well-designed for endurance athletes. However, the solution has two notable deficiencies: (1) it doesn't explicitly address pre/post-workout nutrition timing as requested in the secondary criteria, and (2) there are minor mathematical inconsistencies in the macronutrient totals. These are secondary criterion issues rather than mandatory requirement violations, placing the solution in the 7-8 range rather than 9-10."

    "reasoning": "The solution comprehensively meets all mandatory requirements with precise daily caloric total, detailed macronutrient breakdown, and complete meal specifications with portions and timing. All secondary criteria are satisfied: dietary restrictions are strictly adhered to (vegan, gluten-free, tree nut-free), protein exceeds minimum requirements from appropriate plant sources, and carbohydrates are sufficient for endurance training. The plan spans a full day with six eating occasions appropriately distributed. Minor weaknesses exist in training-specific optimization (meal timing relative to workouts) and lack of hydration guidance, but these do not constitute failures against the stated criteria. The solution is well-structured, practical, and directly addresses the task requirements."
